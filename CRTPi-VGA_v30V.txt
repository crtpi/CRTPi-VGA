**Required Hardware:**

* Raspberry Pi 3B/B+
* Gert VGA666 adapter (or HDMI to VGA)
* 31khz VGA PC CRT monitor
* VGA cable
* 5v 2.5A Micro USB power supply
* 4GB+ SD Card

**What is this?**

Since I've been relegated to working from home for the next forever, I needed something to pass the time. Lots of users have asked for, and worked with me to create a solution for what we'll call the "Poor Man's BVM." A $5 Gert VGA666 adapter, cheap/free 31khz VGA Monitor, and a Pi packed with roms. What could be a better way to pass the quarantine? 

For a long time, there were several stumbling blocks: 

* The Pi wasn't capable of switching from baked-in DMT resolutions and DMT mode 87 (custom timings).
* Very few (if any) CEA modes will sync properly with a VGA monitor.
* Using hdmi_cvt was hit or miss, and less robust than hdmi_timings.
* Nobody was reporting any working 480i or 480p hdmi_timings anywhere on the net. I had to modify how I was searching and find something else.

I finally stumbled upon some old threads with people listing out some 640x480 hdmi_timings, and that cracked the whole case wide open. I finally had the missing piece that could be slotted into my existing images. The end result is Emulationstation and other non-libretro emulators launching in 640x480p @ 65hz (great for PSP, DOSbox, ScummVM, and Kodi!) and all Retroarch emulators launching in 2048x240p or 1920x240p @ 120hz. 

I opted to steer away from Black Frame Insertion and instead change the VSync Swap interval to 2 (running the framerate at half of 120hz). This solves the intermittent flicker and also the reduced gamma from BFI. Overall, it's a much more pleasing experience IMO. You can always change VSync Interval back to 1, and enable BFI in Retroarch if you the other way is better.

**What Does That Look Like?**

[Here's a bunch of pics I took, some better than others!](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNO6y2Vjt0jFrwY0kYbgsD-R2-KjNFuaDqKrFZQsCebWi6O1nZAF4ozajdksLw7KQ?key=WGVHbWMxLXd2ZlFqbFhGZ3BLRjZTSE42S1FNVFdB)

**What is Run-Ahead?**

> [The Run Ahead feature calculates the frames as fast as possible in the background to "rollback" the action as close as possible to the input command requested.](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/)

I've enabled run-ahead on most of the 8 & 16-bit consoles and handhelds. A single frame (and using the second instance) is saved here, which dramatically improves input lag without affecting performance on a Pi3B+. More frames would require more hardware power, and may be achievable via overclocking.

    lr-snes9x2010 consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-fceumm consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-beetle-pce-fast consistent 60.1-60.2 @ 60.000000hz

    lr-genesis-gx-plus consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (both genesis and sega cd)

    lr-picodrive consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (master system, game gear, and 32X)

    lr-gambatte consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz (SGB2 framerate)

    lr-mgba consistent 59.8-60.4 FPS @ 60.002220hz (Gamecube framerate)


To disable runahead for a game (or emulator):

    Quick Menu > Latency > Run-Ahead to Reduce Latency > OFF

**What is Snap-Shader?**

It's a Retroarch GSL shader that ensures games on CRT will look as good as on original hardware. It Makes games crisp vertically, and not shimmer horizontally. It correctly aligns the games for you regardless of console. Virtually eliminates the need for separate configurations per core (console).

https://github.com/ektgit/snap-shader-240p

Snap Shader (especially the snap-basic) is super useful on consoles where you may have a mix of horizontal resolutions within the core that you don't necessarily want to set individual game configs for. This is especially useful in PSX, FDS, PCE/PCE-CD, 32X, and MAME.

So far, the image is only set up for Snap-Basic (Pass: 1, Filter: Nearest, Scale: Don't Care) on lr-PCSX-ReARMed. If you care to, I would definitely try it out on other emulators. Here's the enable process:

* Quick Menu > Shaders
* Video Shaders > On
* Shader Passes > 1
* Shader #0 > snap-basic.glsl
* Shader #0 Filter > Nearest
* Shader #0 Scale > Don't Care
* Save > Save Core Preset

**What Does This NOT Have?**

This doesn't have any ROMs (other than freeware test suites), BIOS files, music, screenshots, metadata, or videos concerning copy-written games. Other than the configurations and overlays, it has nothing that can't be downloaded through the repository or freeware.

**Where Can I Get It?**

You can download a premade image from Google Drive:

> NOTE: Please expand your file system via Raspi-Config after your first boot, and reboot!

**I have X Issue! Help?**

***I only have like 500mb of free space on my XXgb SD card!***

You need to expand your file system via Raspi-Config. Follow [these](https://crispconcept.com/pages/expand-sd-card) steps. 

***GBA, PSX, Neo-Geo, Sega-CD, PCE-CD, etc. games don't work!***

I haven't included any bios's that didn't come with the retropie stock image, so you'll need to install the appropriate files in the BIOS folder.  For Neo-Geo, I highly recommend the UniBios (renamed to neogeo.zip).

***Samba Share won't work after I set up Wi-Fi!***

Samba share service starts on boot, pending that a network is available. Configure your Wi-Fi then reboot first, and if that doesn't fix it then go into Retropie Setup > Configuration/Tools > Samba > Install Samba.  Once it's complete, reboot and it should be golden.

***USB-Romservice and/or Retropie-Mount don't work!***

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive), but follow these steps before plugging in your thumb drive:

* Go to Retropie-Setup
* Update retropie install script
* Go to Manage Packages -> Optional Packages
* Scroll all the way down to usbromservice
* Uninstall usbromservice
* Install it again from Binary
* Once finished, choose Configuration, then Enable USB Romservice
* Reboot, and wait for it to fully boot in to ES
* Plug in USB stick (has to be FAT32) and WAIT A LONG TIME (if your stick has a light, wait for it to stop flashing)
